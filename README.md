# Self-Care Center 

### Abstract:
Have you ever been having one of those days and you just need a quick mental/spiritual pick-me-up that's not coffee or a nap? 
Introduction the **Self Care Center**, an app that sends positive messages straight to you, the user. 

### Features:
- When you first visit the sight, experience the soothing color pallete and fade-in text that whispers "It's all going to be okay."
- Choose between a mantra or an affirmation and then click the receive message button. The selected message will be displayed for your self-care benefit. 
- If you want to remember the message forever, or at least until you exit the webpage, click the small **+** button located directly below the received message.
- Once the **+** button is clicked, a **View Favorites** button will appear. If clicked, you will be taken to the *Favorites Page*, where every favorited message will be displayed.
- Hover over the small **X** button and a message will be displayed telling the user to *double click to remove message*. If a message is double clicked, it will immediately disappear from the page and be removed from the Data Model. 
- If you wish to return to the *Home Page*, simply press the **Take Me Home** button.

- For extra Self Care fun, hover your mouse over the meditation icon before receiving a message when the page loads.

### Learning Goals:
The main learning goals for this project were centered around getting exposure to the interconnectedness of CSS, HTML, and Javascript. I feel much better about navigating between these, and the purpose for which each is used in programming.
