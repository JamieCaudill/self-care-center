# Self Care Center
## Overview
How can I care for myself? One way is with affirmations and mantras!
Affirmations are thoughts of positive self-empowerment, meant to assert your self-worth.
Mantras are repetive phrases that are repeated again and again during mindfulness practices. Your challenge is to build an app that helps users remind themselves of their inherent value!

This Solo Challenge gives students and instructors the opportunity to get a pulse on where you are with the foundational concepts of Module 1 curriculum. Students should use this as an opportunity to challenge themselves and work completely independently. Google can (and probably should!) be used, but any other code base should not be referenced. Instructors will be able to use your work, both completion of functionality and code quality, to determine where you stand and if you are behind for this point in the module, provide supports to intervene.

The spec for this project can be found [here](https://frontend.turing.io/projects/module-1/self-care-center.html).

# Self-Care Center 

### Abstract:
Have you ever been having one of those days and you just need a quick mental/spiritual pick-me-up that's not coffee or a nap? 
Introduction the **Self Care Center**, an app that sends positive messages straight to you, the user. 

### Features:
- When you first visit the sight, experience the soothing color pallete and fade-in text that whispers "It's all going to be okay."
- Choose between a mantra or an affirmation and then click the receive message button. The selected message will be displayed for your self-care benefit. 
- If you want to remember the message forever, or at least until you exit the webpage, click the small **+** button located directly below the received message.
- Once the **+** button is clicked, a **View Favorites** button will appear. If clicked, you will be taken to the *Favorites Page*, where every favorited message will be displayed.
- Hover over the small **X** button and a message will be displayed telling the user to *double click to remove message*. If a message is double clicked, it will immediately disappear from the page and be removed from the Data Model. 
- If you wish to return to the *Home Page*, simply press the **Take Me Home** button.

- For extra Self Care fun, hover your mouse over the meditation icon before receiving a message when the page loads.

### Learning Goals:
The main learning goals for this project were centered around getting exposure to the interconnectedness of CSS, HTML, and Javascript. I feel much better about navigating between these, and the purpose for which each is used in programming. 

### Wins + Challenges:
